# Dynamic Form with Validation

This project demonstrates a dynamic HTML form with real-time validation using JavaScript. The form is styled with CSS and includes features such as input validation, error messages, and submission feedback.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The form is designed to adapt to various screen sizes.
- **Real-Time Validation:** Inputs are validated in real-time as the user types or interacts with form fields.
- **Custom Error Messages:** Clear and concise error messages guide the user to fix incorrect inputs.
- **Strong Password Validation:** Ensures passwords are secure by enforcing a set of rules.
- **Interactive Elements:** Dynamic behavior for dropdowns and checkboxes.
- **Form Submission Feedback:** Displays a success message upon successful submission.

## File Structure

- **`index.html`**: Contains the HTML structure of the form.
- **Inline CSS**: Styles the form to ensure a clean and modern user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements real-time validation and submission handling.

## Form Fields

1. **First Name**
    - Required.
    - Error message: "First name cannot be blank."

2. **Last Name**
    - Required.
    - Error message: "Last name cannot be blank."

3. **Email**
    - Required.
    - Error message: "You cannot leave the email blank."

4. **Password**
    - Required.
    - Must include:
      - At least 8 characters.
      - At least one uppercase letter.
      - At least one lowercase letter.
      - At least one number.
      - At least one special character.
    - Error messages:
      - "Password must not be blank."
      - "Password must be at least 8 characters long, with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character."

5. **Confirm Password**
    - Required.
    - Must match the password.
    - Error message: "Passwords do not match."

6. **Gender**
    - Dropdown with options: Male, Female, Other.
    - Error message: "Please select your gender."

7. **Terms and Conditions**
    - Checkbox.
    - Error message: "You must accept the terms and conditions."

## How It Works

1. **Real-Time Validation:**
    - Event listeners on input fields validate data as the user types.
    - Validation rules are applied, and appropriate error messages are shown if rules are violated.

2. **Submission Handling:**
    - On form submission, all fields are validated.
    - If any field is invalid, the corresponding error message is displayed.
    - If all fields are valid, a success message is displayed.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Fill out the form and interact with the validation features.

## Customization

You can customize the form by:

1. **Adding New Fields:**
    - Add a new `<div>` with the `form-group` class.
    - Add the corresponding validation logic in the `<script>` section.

2. **Styling:**
    - Modify the CSS styles in the `<style>` block.

3. **Validation Rules:**
    - Update the JavaScript logic to apply new or additional rules.
